# Erik Van den Bosch Vidal

### I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer inclined towards Back-end development. Focused on managing and organizing the data in order to facilitate the usage and readability thereof, as well as attaining scalability and simplicity.

‚Åú My experience is exclusively academical. At first I signed up to the career of Audiovisual Production, where I learned to work with a team at a group project about simulating the logistic planning of a short film.

‚Åú After realizing that production wasn't my field, I found Henry's Bootcamp, where I spent +700hs into the world of Development. There, I was able to exploit my creativity and curiosity. I learned to make functional apps and was exposed to a learning pace I couldn't have thought possible otherwise.
I have knowledge of [MERN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
